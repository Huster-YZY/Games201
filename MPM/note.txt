My Plan

At first, I want to implement a explicit MPM which doesn't
need to solve a huge linear system to help me have a better understanding of MPM.

Then, I'd like to introduce different materials and collision-detection into my project.

Finally, after being familiar with how MPM works, I will endeavourã€€to implement an implicit
MPM with MGPCG(Multi Grid Preconditioning Conjugate Gradient), which is a very powerful but 
complex tool used to solve linear system.

At the end, I will try to combine simulation method with Reinforcement Learning and propose
some good ideas about S4L.
