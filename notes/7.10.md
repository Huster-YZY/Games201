### Deformation
- Deformation map
$$x_{defomed}=\phi (x_{rest})$$
- Deformation gradient
$$F=\frac{\partial x_{deformed}}{\partial x_{rest}}$$
- volume ratio
$$J=det(F)$$

### Hyperelasticity
- strain energy density function $\Psi$.
- Stress tensor
$$P(F)=\frac{\partial \Psi(F)}{\partial F}$$
- Hyperelastic material models:Neo-Hookean, Corotated, Linear elasticity

### FEM
Linear FEM asumes the deformation map is affine,thus the deformation gradient is constant.
- F can be wrote as a multiplication of two matrixs.
- For lagrangian method,we update position and velocity of each node at each iteration.To update velocity, we have to compute acceleration/force and force can be described as the gradient of energy(energy is an integral of energy density function),so we just need to add the energy of the elements which this node belong to, and diffentiate it with this node’s position.(Taichi’s auto diff system can help us execute one order differential.)

### Young’s modulus
Young’s modulus can represent material’s stiffness.Bigger Young’s modulus means harder material, also easier to lead numerical explosion.
- $$strss=\frac{F}{S}$$
- $$strain=\frac{\triangle L}{L}$$
- $$Y=\frac{stress}{strain}=\frac{FL}{S\triangle L}=kL$$
