<h2 center=align>High Performance Computation</h2>

### Computer Structure
- Parallel Computing->Computation is cheap.
- Limited bandwith->Communication is expensive.
- Make a good use of temporary locality and spatial locality.

### Taichi Advance Feature
- Snode: A tree structure which can be used control the data layout.(AOS & SOA)
- Space ordinate offsets
- Sparse Data structure(Pointer).Inspired by VDB.

Philosophy: Only locate memory for those necessary.

(May have some connection with Oct-tree/Kd-tree)
