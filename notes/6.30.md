### Lagrangian & Eulerian
- Largrangian: moving particles in fluid
- Eulerian: fixed grids in fluid

### Mass-spring system
A combination of Hookeâ€™s law and Newtonâ€™s second law.
$$f_{ij}=-k(||x_i-x_j||_2- l _{ij})(x_i-x_j)$$
### Time Integration
A numerical method uesd to compute the integration
- Explict(easy to implement but not stable)
<text> 

This method have to control the timestep to avoid Numerical Explosion.This is a formula used to estimate the appropriate value
of  the timestep.
</text>
$$\triangle t\le c\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$$

- Implicit( stable but expensive)

For implicit method, we usually need to combine all equations to merge them into one equation.

### SPH (Smoothed Particle)
Use particles to approximate the field.

This method also have to meet a constraint:
$$\frac{u\triangle t}{\triangle x} \le C_{max}$$

This method can be optimized on neighborhood search.(Hashing)

### How to construct the surface from particles?
