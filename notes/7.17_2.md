<h2 align=center>Hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian Method</h2>

**Idea**: Lagrangian is convinent for advection and Eulerian is good on projection. So, to make a good use of these two different view, some researchers propose hybrif lagrangian-eulerian method. In general, this skeleton has three parts including P2G, Grid Computation, G2P.

### PIC
- G2P (Quardratic B-spline)
- Projection
- P2G

Question: Energy loss, dissipation.

### APIC, polyPIC, FLIP
To solve the disipation exists in PIC, ther have two ways to solve the numerical loss.

- Transfer more information: APIC, polyPIC.
- Transfer the delta: FLIP

For pure FLIP, its surface is very noisy, to reduce this phenomenon, we can combine FLIP(noisy) with PIC(dissipation) by using liner interpolation.
$$simulation=0.99FLIP+0.01PIC$$

### MLSâ€”MPM
APIC+MPM
- High efficiency
- Easy to implement
