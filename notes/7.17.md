### Galerkin Method
Galerkin Method is a kind of numerical methods which transforms continus PDE problem to discrete linear system ($Ax=b$).

### FEM Poisson Equation Discretization
- transform strong form to weak form (by using test funtion)
- divergence theorem (Green,Gauss)
- discretization (Base function, Interpolation)
- arrange equation to a linear system
$$\mathrm K u=\mathrm{f}$$

### Topology Optimization
Minimize the objective functino with some constraints.
